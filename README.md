# shuttle

[Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) is a serverless platform for Rust which makes it really easy to 
deploy your web-apps.

Shuttle is built for productivity, reliability and performance:
- Zero-Configuration support for Rust using annotations
- Automatic resource provisioning (databases, caches, subdomains, etc.) via [Infrastructure-From-Code](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2022/05/09/ifc)
- First-class support for popular Rust frameworks ([Rocket](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/tree/main/examples/rocket/hello-world), [Axum](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/tree/main/examples/axum/hello-world), 
  [Tide](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/tree/main/examples/tide/hello-world) and [Tower](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle/tree/main/examples/tower/hello-world))
- Scalable hosting (with optional self-hosting)


## Getting Started

First download the Shuttle cargo extension and login:

```bash
$ cargo install cargo-shuttle
$ cargo shuttle login
```

Create your first shuttle app with `rocket` framework:

```bash
$ cargo shuttle init --rocket hello-world
```

Your `Cargo.toml` should look like:

```toml
[package]
name = "hello-world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]

[dependencies]
shuttle-service = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["web-rocket"] }
rocket = "0.4.11"
```


Your shuttle app in `lib.rs` should look like:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_service::main]
async fn rocket() -> shuttle_service::ShuttleRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/hello", routes![index]);

    Ok(rocket)
}
```

Deploy:

```bash
$ cargo shuttle deploy
   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1m 01s

        Project:            hello-world
        Deployment Id:      3d08ac34-ad63-41c1-836b-99afdc90af9f
        Deployment Status:  DEPLOYED
        Host:               hello-world.shuttleapp.rs
        Created At:         2022-04-01 08:32:34.412602556 UTC
