  -h, --help                                   Print help
  -V, --version                                Print version
```

### Subcommand: `init`

To initialize a shuttle project with boilerplates, run `cargo shuttle init [OPTIONS] [PATH]`.

Currently, `cargo shuttle init` supports the following frameworks:

- `--actix-web`: for [actix web](https://actix.rs/) framework
- `--axum`: for [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework
- `--poem`: for [poem](https://github.com/poem-web/poem) framework
- `--poise`: for [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) discord bot framework
- `--rocket`: for [rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework
- `--salvo`: for [salvo](https://salvo.rs/) framework
- `--serenity`: for [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) discord bot framework
- `--thruster`: for [thruster](https://github.com/thruster-rs/Thruster) framework
- `--tide`: for [tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide) framework
- `--tower`: for [tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) library
- `--warp`: for [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) framework

For example, running the following command will initialize a project for [rocket](https://rocket.rs/):

```sh
cargo shuttle init --rocket my-rocket-app
```

This should generate the following dependency in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
rocket = "0.5.0-rc.2"
shuttle-rocket = { version = "0.12.0" }
shuttle-runtime = { version = "0.12.0" }
tokio = { version = "1.26.0" }
```

The following boilerplate code should be generated into `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[shuttle_runtime::main]
async fn rocket() -> shuttle_rocket::ShuttleRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/hello", routes![index]);

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```

### Subcommand: `run`

To run the shuttle project locally, use the following command:

```sh
# Inside your shuttle project
cargo shuttle run
```

This will compile your shuttle project and start it on the default port `8000`. Test it by:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8000/hello
Hello, world!
```

### Subcommand: `login`

Use `cargo shuttle login` inside your shuttle project to generate an API key for the shuttle platform:

```sh
# Inside a shuttle project
cargo shuttle login
```

This should automatically open a browser window with an auto-generated API key for your project. Simply copy-paste the API key back in your terminal or run the following command to complete login:

```sh
cargo shuttle login --api-key <your-api-key-from-browser>
```

### Subcommand: `deploy`

To deploy your shuttle project to the cloud, run:

```sh
cargo shuttle project new
cargo shuttle deploy
```

Your service will immediately be available at `{crate_name}.shuttleapp.rs`. For instance:

```sh
$ curl https://my-rocket-app.shuttleapp.rs/hello
Hello, world!
```

### Subcommand: `status`

Check the status of your deployed shuttle project with:

```sh
cargo shuttle status
```

### Subcommand: `logs`

Check the logs of your deployed shuttle project with:

```sh
cargo shuttle logs
```

### Subcommand: `stop`

Once you are done with a deployment, you can stop it by running:

```sh
cargo shuttle stop
```

Thanks for using `cargo-shuttle`! We’re very happy to have you with us!

During our alpha period, API keys are completely free and you can deploy as many services as you want.

Just keep in mind that there may be some kinks that require us to take all deployments down once in a while. In certain circumstances we may also have to delete all the data associated with those deployments.

To contribute to `cargo-shuttle` or stay updated with our development, please [open an issue, discussion or PR on Github](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle) and [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/H33rRDTm3p)! 🚀
