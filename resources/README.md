# Resources / Plugins

## Managed resources

The list of managed resources (Shared DB, AWS RDS, Secrets) is always growing.
If you feel we are missing a resource you would like, then feel to create a feature request for your desired resource.

## Writing your own plugins

Check out [custom resource examples](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle-examples/tree/main/custom-resource) or the plugins in this directory for how to implement the `ResourceInputBuilder` trait.
