In this post we're going to be comparing two popular Rust libraries used for building web applications. We'll be writing an example in each and compare their ergonomics and how they perform.

The first library [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) is a low level HTTP library which contains the primitives for building server applications. The second library [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) comes with more "batteries included" and provides a more declarative approach to building web applications.

## The Demo

We're going to build a simple site to showcase how each libraries implements:

### Routing

Routing decides what to respond for a given URL. Some paths are fixed, in our example we will have a fixed route `/` which returns `Hello World`. Some paths are dynamic and can have parameters. In the example we will have `/hello/*name*` which will response `Hello *name*` which will have *name* substituted in each response.

### Shared state

We want to have a central state for the application.

In this demo we will have central site visitor counter which counts the number of requests. This number can be viewed as JSON on the `/counter.json` route. In this example we will be storing the counter in application memory. However if you were storing it in a database the shared state would be a database client.

The are lots of other functionality necessary for a site such as handling HTTP methods, receiving data, rendering templates and error handling. But for the scope of this post and example we will only be comparing these two features.

### The rules

The rules for this demonstration is to only use the specific library and any of its re-exported dependencies. So no additional libraries (except in the hyper example we need a `tokio::main`).

## Hyper

Hyper's readme describes hyper as a "A fast and correct HTTP implementation for Rust with client and server APIs". For this demo we will be using the server side of the library. It has **9.7k** stars on GitHub and **48M** crates downloads. It is used as a often a dependency and many other libraries such as [reqwest and tonic](https://crates.io/crates/hyper/reverse_dependencies) build on top of it.

In this example we see how far we can get with just using the library. This demo uses Hyper 0.14[^hyper-deps]. Below is the full code for the site:

```rust
use hyper::server::conn::AddrStream;
use hyper::service::{make_service_fn, service_fn};
use hyper::{Body, Request, Response, Server};
use std::convert::Infallible;
use std::sync::{atomic::AtomicUsize, Arc};

#[derive(Clone)]
struct AppContext {
    pub counter: Arc<AtomicUsize>,
}

async fn handle(context: AppContext, req: Request<Body>) -> Result<Response<Body>, Infallible> {
    // Increment the visit count
    let new_count = context
        .counter
        .fetch_add(1, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);

    if req.method().as_str() != "GET" {
        return Ok(Response::builder().status(406).body(Body::empty()).unwrap());
    }

    let path = req.uri().path();
    let response = if path == "/" {
        Response::new(Body::from("Hello World"))
    } else if path == "/counter.json" {
        let data = format!("{{\"counter\":{}}}", new_count);
        Response::builder()
            .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
            .body(Body::from(data))
	        .unwrap()
    } else if let Some(name) = path.strip_prefix("/hello/") {
        Response::new(Body::from(format!("Hello, {}!", name)))
    } else {
        Response::builder().status(404).body(Body::empty()).unwrap()
    };
    Ok(response)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let context = AppContext {
        counter: Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(0)),
    };

    let make_service = make_service_fn(move |_conn: &AddrStream| {
        let context = context.clone();
        let service = service_fn(move |req| handle(context.clone(), req));
        async move { Ok::<_, Infallible>(service) }
    });

    let server = Server::bind(&"127.0.0.1:3000".parse().unwrap())
        .serve(make_service)
        .await;

    if let Err(e) = server {
        eprintln!("server error: {}", e);
    }
}
```

At the top we define a `handle` function which processes all the requests.

Routing is done through the chain of ifs and elses in the `handle` function. First the path of the request (e.g `/` for the index) is extracted using `req.uri().path()`. Fixed routes are easy to branch on using string comparison like `path == "/"`. For routes which match multiple paths such as the `/hello/<user>` route it uses [`str::strip_prefix`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.strip_prefix) which returns a `None` if the path doesn't
start with the prefix or `Some` if the path starts with the prefix along with a slice that proceeds the prefix.

```rust
"/".strip_prefix("/hello/") == None
"/test".strip_prefix("/hello/") == None
"/hello/jack".strip_prefix("/hello/") == Some("jack")
```

The function has a early return for requests with a method other than GET because there are no POST routes or others for this example. If the site accepted different requests types and had to add additional guards then we could additional clauses to the if statement. Although you could see how expand on the if chain would get more complex and verbose.

To return a response, Hyper re-exports [`Response`](https://docs.rs/hyper/0.14.19/hyper/struct.Response.html) (from the [http crate](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/)). It has a nice simple builder pattern for building the responses. The serialization code is hand written using `format!`. Of course we could import serde but that's against the rules.

The counter is done by creating a struct in the initializing code and cloning it on every request to send to the handler function. Without going into the details it uses `Arc<AtomicUsize>` instead of a `usize` as the atomic variant has special properties for when multiple handlers are using and mutating it. The code increments the visitor counter before anything else in the handler function so that a visit is recorded for all requests.

### Hyper Verdict

In terms of development (on a low end machine we used for profiling[^profile-machine]), a debug build (without any of the build artifacts) takes **79.0s**. After the initial compilation, incremental compilation takes only **1.9s**. For building a `release` build with further optimizations (on top of the debug build artifacts) it takes **32.5s**.

The initialization code was take from [Hyper's server docs](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/server/index.html) and is quite verbose and out of the box for Hyper there are no logs or server information.

In terms of runtime performance over three 30 second connections Hyper responded to on average **74,563** requests per second on the index route on the above code. Which is incredible quick!

## Rocket

Rocket is a "web framework for Rust with a focus on ease-of-use, expressibility, and speed". It has **17.4k** github stars and **1.7M** crates downloads. Rocket internally uses Hyper.

For this demo we are using the `0.5.0-rc2` version of Rocket[^rocket-deps] which builds on Rust stable.

```rust
use rocket::{
    fairing::{Fairing, Info, Kind},
    get, launch, routes,
    serde::{json::Json, Serialize},
    Config, Data, Request, State,
};
use std::sync::atomic::AtomicUsize;

#[derive(Serialize, Default)]
#[serde(crate = "rocket::serde")]
struct AppContext {
    pub counter: AtomicUsize,
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    let config = Config {
        port: 3000,
        ..Config::debug_default()
    };

    rocket::custom(&config)
        .attach(CounterFairing)
        .manage(AppContext::default())
        .mount("/", routes![hello1, hello2, counter])
}

struct CounterFairing;

#[rocket::async_trait]
impl Fairing for CounterFairing {
    fn info(&self) -> Info {
        Info {
            name: "Request Counter",
            kind: Kind::Request,
        }
    }

    async fn on_request(&self, request: &mut Request<'_>, _: &mut Data<'_>) {
        request
            .rocket()
            .state::<AppContext>()
            .unwrap()
            .counter
            .fetch_add(1, std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst);
    }
}

#[get("/")]
fn hello1() -> &'static str {
    "Hello World"
}

#[get("/hello/<name>")]
fn hello2(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}

#[get("/counter.json")]
fn counter(state: &State<AppContext>) -> Json<&AppContext> {
    Json(state.inner())
}
```

In Rocket we describe each endpoint using a function. The `get` macro attribute handles path routing and http method constraint. No need to add early returns for methods and dealing with raw string slices. It takes the declarative approach, `#[get("/hello/<name>")]` is more descriptive and less verbose than `if let Some(name) = path.strip_prefix("/hello/")`. The functions are registered using `.mount("/", routes![hello1, hello2, counter])`.

The application has a state defined here:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Default)]
#[serde(crate = "rocket::serde")]
struct AppContext {
    pub counter: AtomicUsize,
}
```

And it is created and registered using `.manage(AppContext::default())`. Rocket re-exports the serialization library serde so we can use `#[derive(Serialize)]` to generate serialization logic for the counter state, so no hand writing the serialization code unlike first method.

In Rocket endpoint functions can just return `String` or `str` slices and Rocket handles it automatically. Rocket also comes with a `Json` return type and reusing the fact that `AppContext` implements `Serialize` we can freely build a `Json` response from it. The `Json` structure handles setting the `Content-Type` header automatically for us.

Rocket has a middleware implementation which it calls ["fairings"](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/fairings/#fairings). In the example it defines a `CounterFairing` which on every request modifies the counter state. The initialization code is really slim, it sets up a config and a Rocket structure is created using a builder pattern. Annotating the main function with `#[launch]` helps Rocket find the entry point and abstracts how the server is span up. Rocket also has really nice built in logs which are great for development.

### Rocket Verdict

Since Rocket has more dependencies and requires more macro expansion it takes a bit longer build taking **141.9s** (2m 21.9s) on a cold start to compile. A release builds on top of debug artefact takes **147.0s** (2m 27.0s) to compile. Incremental builds are still fast taking **3.3s** to compile after a small change to the response of a endpoint.

Using the same benchmark as Hyper, on average Rocket returned **43,899** requests per second in a release build with the logging disabled - roughly **60%** of Hyper's throughput.

## Conclusion

Writing both of theses examples were fun to build and there weren't any frustrations or problems using them. Both are plenty fast for performance to be a concern.

Rockets documentation is very good and explanatory. All of Hyper's api is well documented on its [docs.rs page](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/). Both libraries are actively developed with many commits and pull requests made in the last month.

Do you prefer the control and speed of Hyper or prefer the expressiveness of Rocket?
