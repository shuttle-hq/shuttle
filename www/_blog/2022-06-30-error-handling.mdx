To quote the Rust Book, 'errors are a fact of life in software'. This post goes
over how to handle them.

Before talking about recoverable errors and the `Result` type, let's first
touch on unrecoverable errors - a.k.a  panics.

## Panics

[Panics](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html) are exceptions a program can throw. It stops all execution in the current thread. When a panic is thrown it returns a short description of what went wrong as well as information about the position of the the panic.

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("error!");
    println!("Never reached :(");
}
```

Running the above causes:

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'error!', examples\panics.rs:2:5
```

They are similar to `throw` in JavaScript and other languages, in that they
don't require an annotation on the function to run and they can pass through
function boundaries. However in Rust, panics cannot be recovered from, there is no way to incept a panic in the current thread.

```rust
fn send_message(s: String) {
    if s.is_empty() {
       panic!("Cannot send empty message");
    } else {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The `send_message` function is fallible (can go wrong). If this is called
with an empty message then the program stops running. There is no way for the callee to track that an error has occurred.

For recoverable errors, Rust has a type for error handling in the standard
library called a **`Result`**. It is a generic type, which means the result
and error variant can basically be whatever you want.

```rust
pub enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

## Basic error creation and handling

At the moment our `send_message` function doesn't return anything. This means no information can be received by the callee. We can change the definition to instead return a `Result` and rather than panicking we can early return a `Result::Err`.

```rust
fn send_message(s: String) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    if s.is_empty() {
        // Note the standard prelude includes `Err` so the `Result::Err` and `Err` are equivalent
        return Result::Err("message is empty")
    } else {
        // ...
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Now our function actually returns information about what went wrong we can handle it when we call it:

```rust
if let Err(send_error) = send_message(message) {
    show_user_error(send_error);
}
```

### Rust knows when a Result is unused.

In the above example we inspect the value of the item and branch on it.
However, if we didn't inspect and handle the returned Result then the Rust
compiler gives use a helpful warning about it so that you don't forget to
explicitly deal with errors in your program.

```
|     send_message();
|     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
= note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default
= note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant, which should be handled
```

### Examples of `Result` in the standard library

`Result` can be found in most libraries. On of my favorite examples is the
return type of the [FromStr::from_str](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html#tymethod.from_str) trait method. With [str::parse](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.parse) (which uses the `FromStr` trait) we can do the following:

```rust
fn main() {
	let mut input = String::new();
	std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();

	match input.trim_end().parse::<f64>() {
		Ok(number) => {
			dbg!(number);
		}
		Err(err) => {
			dbg!(err);
		}
	};
}
```

(We'll ignore the `unwrap` for now 😉)

```js
$ cargo r --example input -q
10
[examples\input.rs:7] number = 10.0

$ cargo r --example input -q
100
[examples\input.rs:7] number = 100.0

$ cargo r --example input -q
bad
[examples\input.rs:10] err = ParseFloatError {
    kind: Invalid,
}
```

Here we can see when we type in a number we get a `Ok` variant with the number else we get a [ParseFloatError](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.ParseFloatError.html)

## Files, networks and databases

**All errors occur when you interact with the outside world or things
outside the Rust runtime**. One of the places where a lot of errors can
occur is interacting with the file system. The `File::open` function
attempts to open a file. This can fail for a variety of reasons. The
filename is invalid, the file doesn't exist or you simply don't have
permission to read the file. Notice the errors are well-defined and known
before-hand. You can even access the error variants with the [`kind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.Error.html#method.kind) function
and in order to implement your program logic or return an instructive error
message to the user.

### Aliasing Results and errors

When you're working on a project you'll often find yourself repeating
yourself when it comes to return types in function signatures:

```rust
fn foo() -> Result<SomeType, MyError> {
...
}
```

To give a concrete example, all functions which operate on the FS have the same
errors (file not exists, invalid permissions). [io::Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html) is a alias over a result but means that every function does not have to specify the error type:

```rust
pub type Result<T> = Result<T, io::Error>;
```

If you have an API which has a common error type, you may want to
consider this pattern.

### The question mark operator

One of the best things about Results is the question mark operator, The
question mark operator can short circuit Result
error values. Let's look at a simple function which uploads text from a file.
This can error in a bunch of different ways:

```rust
fn upload_file() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    let text = match std::fs::read_to_string("file.txt").map_err(|_| "read file error") {
        Ok(value) => value,
        Err(err) => {
            return err;
        }
    };
    if let Err(err) = upload_text(text) {
        return err
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Hang on, we're writing Rust not Go!

If a `?` is postfixed on to a Result (or anything that implements [`try`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Try.html) so also `Option`) we can
obtain a functionally equivalent outcome with a much more readable and
concise syntax.

```rust
fn upload_file() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    let text = std::fs::read_to_string("file.txt").map_err(|_| "read file error")?;
    upload_text(text)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

As long as the calling function also returns a `Result` with the
same `Error` type, `?` saves a ton of explicit code being written. Moreover,
the question-mark implicitly runs [Into::into](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html#tymethod.into)
(which is automatically implemented for [From](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html) implementors) on the error value. So we don't have to worry about converting the error before we use the operator:

```rust
// This derive means we get a a into implementation for `std::io::Error -> MyError`
#[derive(derive_enum_from_into::EnumFrom)]
enum MyError {
    IoError(std::io::Error)
    // ...
}

fn do_stuff() -> Result<(), MyError> {
    let file = File::open("data.csv")?;
    // ...
}
```

We will look at more patterns for combining error types later!

## [The Error trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html)

The [Error](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#) trait is
defined in the standard library. It basically
represents the expectations of error values - values of type `E` in
`Result<T,E>`
[The Error trait is implemented for many errors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#implementors)
and provides a unified API for information on errors. The Error trait is a bit needy and requires that the error implements both [Debug](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html) and [Display](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html). While it can be cumbersome to implement we will see some helper libraries for doing so later on.

In the standard library [VarError](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/enum.VarError.html) (for reading environment variables) and [ParseIntError](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/num/struct.ParseIntError.html) (for parsing a string slice as a integer) are different errors. When we interact them we need to differentiate between the types because they have different properties and different stack sizes. To build a combination of them we could build a sum type using a enum. Alternatively we can use dynamically dispatched traits which handled varying stack sized items and other type information.

Using the above mentioned try syntax (`?`) we can convert the the above errors to be dynamically dispatched. This makes it easy to handle different errors without building enums to combine errors.

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let key = std::env::var("NUMBER_IN_ENV")?;
    let number = key.parse::<i32>()?;
    println!("\"NUMBER_IN_ENV\" is {}", number);
    Ok(())
}
```

While this is a easy way to handle errors, it isn't easy to differentiate between the types and can make handling errors in libraries hard. More information on this later.

### The Error trait vs Results and enums

One thing when using an enum is we can use `match` to branch on the enum
error variants. On the other hand, with the `dyn` trait unless you go down
the down casting path it is very hard to get specific information about the
error:

```rust
match my_enum_error {
    FsError(err) => {
        report_fs_error(err)
    },
    DbError(DbError { err, database }) => {
        report_db_error(database, err)
    },
}
```

For reusable libraries it is better to use enums to combine errors so that
users of your library can handle the specifics themselves. But for CLIs and
other applications using the trait can be a lot simpler.

## Methods on Result

Result and Option contains many useful functions. Here are some of my commonly used:

### [Result::map](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.map)

This maps or converts the `Ok` value if it exists. This can be more concise
than using the `?` operator.

```rust
fn string_to_plus_one(s: &str) -> Result<i32, std::num::ParseIntError> {
    s.parse::<i32>().map(|num| num + 1)
}
```

### [Result::ok](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.ok)

Useful for converting Results to Options

```rust
assert_eq!(Ok(2).ok(), Some(2));
assert_eq!(Err("err!").ok(), None);
```

### [Option::ok_or_else](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.ok_or_else)

Useful for going the other way in converting from Options to Results

```rust
fn get_first(vec: &Vec<i32>) -> Result<&i32, NotInVec> {
    vec.first().ok_or_else(|| NotInVec)
}
```

### Error handling for iteration

Using results in iterator chains can be a little confusing. Luckily `Result`
implements [collect](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.collect).
We can use this to short circuit an iterator if an error
occurs. In the following, if all the `parse`s succeed then we get collected vec of numbers result. If one fails then it instead returns a Result with the failing Err.

```rust
fn main() {
	let a = ["1", "2", "not a number"]
		.into_iter()
		.map(|a| a.parse::<f64>())
		.collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>();
	dbg!(a);
}
```

```
[examples\iteration.rs:6] a = Err( ParseFloatError { kind: Invalid, }, )
```

Removing the `"not a number"` entry

```
[examples\iteration.rs:3] a = Ok( [ 1.0, 2.0, ], )
```

Because Rust iterators are *piecewise* and lazy the iterator can short circuit without evaluating parse on any of the later items.

## More Panic

### Special panics

`todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`, `unreachable!()` are all wrappers for `panic!
()` which but are specialized to their situation. Panics have a special [`!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/never.html)
type, called the 'never type', which represents the result of computations
that never complete (also means it can be passed anywhere):

```rust
fn func_i_havent_written_yet() -> u32 {
    todo!()
}
```

Sometimes there is Rust code which the compiler cannot properly infer is
valid. For this type of situation, the `unreachable!` panic can be used:

```rust
fn get_from_vec_else_zero(a: Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    if let Some(value) = a.get(2) {
        if let Some(prev_value) = a.get(1) {
            prev_value
        } else {
            unreachable!()
        }
    } else {
        0
    }
}
```

### Unwrapping

`unwrap` is a method on `Result` and `Option`. They return the `Ok` or `Some`
variant or else panic...

```rust
// result.unwrap()

let value = if let Ok(value) = result {
    value
} else {
    panic!("Unwrapped!")
};
```

The uses cases for this is developer error and situations the compiler can't
quite figure out.
If you are just trying something and don't want to set up a full error handling system then they can be used to ignore compiler warnings.

Even if the situation calls for `unwrap` you are better off using `expect`
which has an accompanying message - you'll be thanking your past self when the
`expect` error message helps you find the root cause of an issue 2 weeks
down the line.

### Panics in the standard library

It is important to note that some of the APIs in the standard library *can*
panic. You should look out for these annotations in the docs. One of them is
[Vec::remove](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#panics-6).
If you use this you should ensure that the argument is in its indexable range.

```rust
fn remove_at_idx(a: usize, vec: &mut Vec<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    if a < idx.len() {
        Some(vec.remove(a))
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

## Handling multiple errors and helper crates:

Handling errors from multiple libraries and APIs can become challenging as
you have to deal with a bunch of different types. They are different sizes
and contain different information. To unify the types we have to build a sum
type using an enum, in order to ensure they have the same size at compile time.

```rust
enum Errors {
    FileSystemError(..),
    StringParseError(..),
    NetworkError(..),
}
```

Some crates for making creating these unifying enums easier:

### [thiserror](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror)

`thiserror` provides a derive implementation which adds the Error trait for us.
As previously mentioned, to implement Error we have to implement display and
thiserrors' `#[error]` attributes provide templating for the displayed errors.

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum DataStoreError {
    #[error("data store disconnected")]
    Disconnect(#[from] io::Error),
    #[error("the data for key `{0}` is not available")]
    Redaction(String),
    #[error("invalid header (expected {expected:?}, found {found:?})")]
    InvalidHeader {
        expected: String,
        found: String,
    },
    #[error("unknown data store error")]
    Unknown,
}
```

### [anyhow](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow)

`anyhow` provides an ergonomic and idiomatic alternative to explicitly
handling errors. It is similar to the previously mentioned error trait but
has additional features such as adding context to thrown errors.

This is really, really, useful when you want to convey errors to an
application's users in a context-aware fashion:

```rust
use anyhow::{bail, Result, Context};

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    println!("Hello World!");
    func1().context("while calling func1")?;
    Ok(())
}

fn func1() -> Result<()> {
    func2().context("while calling func2")
}

fn func2() -> Result<()> {
    bail!("Hmm something went wrong ")
}
```

```
Error: while calling func1

Caused by:
    0: while calling func2
    1: Hmm something went wrong
```


Similar to the `Error` trait, `anyhow` suffers from the fact you can't match on
`anyhow`'s result error variant. This is why it is suggested in `anyhow`'s
docs to use `anyhow` for applications and `thiserror` for libraries.

### [eyre](https://crates.io/crates/eyre)

Finally, `eyre` is a fork of `anyhow` and adds more backtrace information.
It's highly customisable and using [color-eyre](https://lib.
rs/crates/color-eyre) we get colors in our panic messages - a little color
always brightens up the dev experience.

```
The application panicked (crashed).
